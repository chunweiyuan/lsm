# liquidstatemachine
A simple investigation of recurrent neural network using integrate-and-fire neurons.

Based on the NEST Initiative, which means NEST needs to be installed, along with the usual suspects (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.)

The simulation-running routine should be in *simulation_manager.py*

Core routines (*lsm.py*, *svm.py*, etc.) are located in `core/`

Some analytical/side routines are currently located in `util/``

*svmlinear.py* contains the scikit-learn linear svm routine.

Not ready for prime time yet.  Last worked on in 2017.
